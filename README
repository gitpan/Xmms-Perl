You need xmms installed to use this package: http://www.xmms.org/

This package provides the following modules:

 Xmms::Remote - Perl interface to the xmms_remote API

 Xmms::Config - Perl interface to the xmms_cfg API

 Xmms - Exports the remote control shell routine

 Xmms::Plugin - Embeds a Perl interpreter inside xmms and provides
                Input/Output/Effect/General plugin interfaces for
                Perl (not yet released, may never be)


For best results, install the bundle via:

 perl -MCPAN -e 'install Bundle::Xmms'

Motivation:
I am a programmer and I need good tunes for programming fuel.
After my dsl installation last week, I finally discovered for myself,
MP3z are the coolest thing since sliced bread.  xmms is a wonderful
tool, but I am not a fan of the GUI.  Not that it isn't well done, it
is very slick.  But, my laptop mouse pad is flakey and I can never
remember what buttons do what.  The interactive shell provides command 
history, command/file completion and emacs key bindings.  The shell
also adds quite a bit functionality over what can be done with xmms
from the command line. And a bit more than the gui, such as searching.
See `perldoc Xmms' for feature details.

Enjoy,
-Doug
